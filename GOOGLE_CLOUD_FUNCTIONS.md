# Google Cloud Functions Architecture - Handyman Auction App

## Overview
This document outlines the serverless functions architecture required to support the Handyman Auction mobile application. These Google Cloud Functions will complement the Convex backend and provide specialized services for authentication, payments, notifications, and third-party integrations.

## Architecture Principles
- **Event-driven**: Functions respond to database changes, HTTP requests, and scheduled events
- **Scalable**: Auto-scaling based on demand
- **Secure**: JWT authentication, API key validation, and encrypted data handling
- **Observable**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- **Cost-effective**: Pay-per-execution model
